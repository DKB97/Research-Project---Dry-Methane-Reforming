The codes and data provided in this repository are used for a numerical analysis of the Dry Reforming of Methane (DRM) reaction.
- Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations use the kinetics package by Mokhov (2017). 
- For simulation kinetics, the ideal gas constant pressure reactor from Cantera is used
- The reaction mechanism (PolyMech) for simulating gas-phase DRM is developed by Porras et al. (2019)
- Three versions of a simplified catalytic reaction mechanism are included, all having a different set of kinetic paramters that followed from fitting.
  
The codes incudes path to datasets and reaction mechanism related to my own directories. Do not forget to change these paths to your own directories
