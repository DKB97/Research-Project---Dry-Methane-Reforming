The codes and data provided in this repository are used for a numerical analysis of the Dry Reforming of Methane (DRM) reaction.
- Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations use the kinetics package by Mokhov (2017). 
- For simulation kinetics, the ideal gas constant pressure reactor from Cantera is used
- The reaction mechanism (PolyMech) for simulating gas-phase DRM is developed by Porras et al. (2019)
